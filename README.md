1- in [A_Q1.ipynb](https://github.com/98210184/Camera-Operations-Homography-and-Fundamental-Matrix-Using-SIFT-KNN-RANSAC-Algorithms/blob/master/A_Q1.ipynb), we will try to find an object in different images using the keypoints extracted from the SIFT, SURF, and ORB detectors. Then we connect them to find the similrities in different pictures.

2- in [A_Q2.ipynb](https://github.com/98210184/Camera-Operations-Homography-and-Fundamental-Matrix-Using-SIFT-KNN-RANSAC-Algorithms/blob/master/A_Q2.ipynb), we use homography matrixes to change the orientation of a given picture to a desired one.

3- in [A_Q3.ipynb](https://github.com/98210184/Camera-Operations-Homography-and-Fundamental-Matrix-Using-SIFT-KNN-RANSAC-Algorithms/blob/master/A_Q3.ipynb), we designed a GUI to show video stream with changing some of the elements like advertisements lively with perspective transform algorithm.

4- in [A_Q4.ipynb](https://github.com/98210184/Camera-Operations-Homography-and-Fundamental-Matrix-Using-SIFT-KNN-RANSAC-Algorithms/blob/master/A_Q4.ipynb), we use the SIFT detector to find the similar keypoints in different images with partly similar contents and then we merge the images as a unique picture of the scene, also known as **Panorama Image**.

5- in [A_Q5.ipynb](https://github.com/98210184/Camera-Operations-Homography-and-Fundamental-Matrix-Using-SIFT-KNN-RANSAC-Algorithms/blob/master/A_Q5.ipynb), we also use the SIFT detector to detect the corners in a chess board and then find the fundamental matrix to recognize patterns in a picture with repetitive patterns.
